Hey, welcome to Dosu's interview, this repository will help us understand your ideas and coding habits, please relax, it won't be difficult.

## Background

Imagine this is a large project, you need to complete a small part of the function, but even so, please consider **maintainability** and the **best coding styles**, this will help us understand your coding styles.

## Requirements

### Level 1: Must-Have ðŸŽ¯
We mostly care about the following things:

1. Functionality: A TODO application, where users can add, query, and delete TODOs (editing is not required).
   - Note: Implementation should include both frontend and backend APIs for data persistence. (Not local storage)
   - Backend APIs should support basic CRUD operations (update action is not required)
2. Testing: The following test coverage is required:
   - API unit tests for backend endpoints
   - Frontend functional tests

### Level 2: Nice-To-Have (Optional) ðŸ’¯
These additions will truly set you apart:

1. Please add the [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) video to explain your code and ideas. It'll help us understand your ideas better.
2. Try to test your code with the various test types:
   - E2E test
   - Code Base-line test
   - Visual Regression test
   - Code coverage reports

### Declaration

- This is an open-ended interview question, please show us your ideas and understanding of frontend development as much as possible.
- Please try to complete it within three hours after we send you the question.
- Allow and support the use of various new technologies and libraries to complete specific functions.
- Please try to complete all the content, if you think some parts are not meaningful, please leave a comment to tell us, thank you.

## Highlights

This is a complete project, you can improve it in any way, such as optimizing loading speed, adding test types, adjusting project structure, introducing new technologies, etc. For the extended parts, you only need to provide pseudocode, you don't need to implement it, even we allow you to only make comments, but please explain your ideas. In short, please show us your ideas, code and your imagination.

## OOS

Dosu serves the open source community, we have a slight expectation for the candidate's open source experience, if possible, please share with us the open source projects or PRs you created or participated in and think are good open source projects or PRs. No stars or no merged PRs are also fine, we just want to understand you better.
